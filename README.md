## Deployment Summary

Your Next.js web application is deployed using a combination of Firebase and Vercel:

### Firebase Authentication

- **Authentication:** User registration, login, and password management are handled by Firebase.
- **User-Centric:** Firebase ensures secure user identity management, freeing you to focus on features.

### Vercel Deployment

- **Client-Side Deployment:** The frontend is hosted on Vercel, automatically built and deployed.
- **Server-Side Deployment:** Vercel hosts the server side, including API routes, using serverless functions.

Leveraging Firebase for authentication and Vercel for deployment, our application benefits from streamlined user management and effortless deployment. This allows you to concentrate on enhancing functionality and user experience.
